# Neural style transfer: Van-Gogh - Picasso - Klimt
I developed a multi image style transfer system, able to easily customize any image to have Van Gogh, Picasso, or Klimt style. This work has been performed by building upon the work by Alexis Jacq in 'Neural Transfer Using PyTorch'.

Here you can find:
- [My Python Code](https://github.com/ANDREAaNAPPI/Real-Estate-Analytics-Melbourne/blob/main/Real_Estate_Melbourne.ipynb)
  This is the whole data pipeline (almost whole; some procedures were not even worth including to keep the elaborate clean)
- [My PDF Report](https://github.com/ANDREAaNAPPI/Real-Estate-Analytics-Melbourne/blob/main/Real%20Estate%20Melbourne%20data%20analysis%20Report.pdf)
  The report was performed as if it had been the final product for a real estate business, so I tried to present the insights and explain them in a non-technical language, including only meaningful insights, and 
  without mentioning unnecessary technical details.
