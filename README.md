# Neural style transfer: Van Gogh - Picasso - Klimt
I developed a multi image style transfer system, able to easily customize any image to have Van Gogh, Picasso, or Klimt style. This work has been performed by building upon the work by Alexis Jacq in 'Neural Transfer Using PyTorch'.

  This includes the data processing, the architectura of the model, and the application, with comments.

  The report includes a general introduction about style transfer, the goal of the elaborate, the architecture, with in depth comments about the implemented feature that allow the model to digest multiple style 
  images, the hyperparameters and the final outcomes
